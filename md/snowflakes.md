We got a lot of snow where I live this year. It has all
melted at this point due to some unusually warm weather
for January, but for about a week everything was coated
with inches of snow.

Snow, of course, is comprised of snowflakes. And a fact
I have not forgotten is that every snowflake is unique.
Buried in the back of my mind in stunning clarity is
a memory of being a little kindergartener making paper
snowflakes while the teacher explained that every single
snowflake was unique.

I find this idea improbable and intriguing.

How much snow falls every year? And how many more
snowflakes never touch the ground but are formed
and then melt somewhere between the sky and the
ground? The number of snowflakes must rival the
number of grains of sand on the beach, if not
far surpass it.

Something so small and so plentiful, how is it possible
that *every single one* would be completely unique?
No, I think that based on the massive economy of scale
that nature employs to mass produce snowflakes nearly
disproves the notion itself. Law of big numbers +
pigeonhole principle, etc.

I can't imagine we've taken an enormous number of
photographs of snowflakes, especially when you
compare that number to the unsurmountable backlog
that nature continuously produces. How many photos
would you need before you found identical twins?

And what is identical? Is it sharing the same basic
shape? Do they need the exact crystal structure?
I'm sure there's interesting applications of graph
theory or computer vision here, but that may be
a tangent for another night.

But it is a remarkable statment. Given billions, trillions,
I-don't-even-know-illions of snowflakes each year, and
yet we confidently declare every single one unique
and special.

Why do we look to snowflakes as a metaphor for our own
uniqueness, where each person is a snowflake and
special in their own right? Maybe the idea of
a small, insignificant snowflake being special just
because it exists appeals to the part of us that
feels small when faced with society and the history
of the human race.

But if every person is a snowflake, each person serves
a greater purpose outside of their own selves. They
may be beautiful and unique, but it is through their
participation as a part in the whole that real change
happens. Without the trillions the landscape is left
ungarnished and dead.

The snow may add beauty, it may add harm, it can
destroy and damage or be built up and be played with.
But it is through the collective snowflakes that
it is worth anything at all.

So I guess my real question is how did snow become
a metaphor for individuality when it so clearly
points to a metaphor for community?

Each person can be special and have a part to play,
but maybe it is together that we get the actually
important things done.

Or we could just keep taking pictures of snowflakes.
